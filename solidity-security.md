## Tips & Tricks
- Ethereum will be updated very frequently until a stable build. So expect new best practices and security consideration every now and then.
- Your code will have bugs and be prepared to handle those. Use techniques such as pausing the contract and limiting usage.
- Keep your contract simple and Modularize.
- Make use of libraries so that you can reuse and update code.
- Try to use already available tools and libraries and update them frquently.
- Never try to store and implement everything in solidity. Use it where decentralization is needed.
